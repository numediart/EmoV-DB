The Emotional Voices Database: Towards Controlling the Emotional Expressiveness in Voice Generation Systems

- This dataset is built for the purpose of emotional speech synthesis. The transcript were based on the CMU arctic database: http://www.festvox.org/cmu_arctic/cmuarctic.data.

- It includes recordings for four speakers- two males and two females.

- The emotional styles are neutral, sleepiness, anger, disgust and amused. 

- Each audio file is recorded in 16bits .wav format 

- Spk-Je (Female, English: Neutral(417 files), Amused(222 files), Angry(523 files), Sleepy(466 files), Disgust(189 files))
- Spk-Bea (Female, English: Neutral(373 files), Amused(309 files), Angry(317 files), Sleepy(520 files), Disgust(347 files))
- Spk-Sa (Male, English: Neutral(493 files), Amused(501 files), Angry(468 files), Sleepy(495 files), Disgust(497 files))
- Spk-Jsh (Male, English: Neutral(302 files), Amused(298 files), Sleepy(263 files))

- File naming (audio_folder): anger_1-28_0011.wav - 1) first word (emotion style), 1-28 - annotation doc file range, Last four digit is the sentence number. 

- File naming (annotation_folder): anger_1-28.TextGrid - 1) first word (emotional style), 1-28- annotation doc range
